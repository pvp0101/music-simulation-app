# music-simulation-app
The Music Simulation App is a MATLAB-based application that allows users to generate and play musical sounds by adjusting parameters such as frequency, amplitude, duration, and waveform. It provides real-time audio playback and signal visualization, helping users understand basic music synthesis and signal processing concepts..

Project Overview:
This project presents a MATLAB-based Music Simulation App that allows users to virtually play instruments like Piano, Drumset, and Octapad. The app demonstrates sound generation, audio playback, and recording using MATLAB App Designer and digital signal processing concepts.
